This is a fork from language-learners (https://github.com/language-learners/phpbb/issues)
custom fork of phpBB, for running the language forum site.

Please read the instructions there. At this time, this fork is to look around and learn. 
Intended scope is to consider installing Advanced BBCode fonctionality. 

## How to Contribute

[Bug reports](https://github.com/language-learners/phpbb/issues) are
always welcome!

If you want to propose a code change, here are a few principles:

1. We strongly prefer to use phpBB 3.1 extensions that plug in cleanly
   using the official extension API.  Actually editing the phpBB source
   code is a last resort.
2. If your proposed change involves a lot of work, or if it would
   substantially alter the feel of the forum, please discuss it on the
   forum first!
3. You can submit your proposed change as an ordinary GitHub "Pull
   Request."
